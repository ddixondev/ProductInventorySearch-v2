    "description": "\nThe PCI Express (PCIe) generation 3, 12 GB Cache RAID SAS quad-port 6 Gb Adapter is a large cache PCIe3 SAS adapter that provides high-performance capabilities and supports the attachment of serial-attached SCSI (SAS) disks and SAS solid-state drives (SSDs) through four mini SAS high-density (HD) connectors. The feature code (FC) EJ0L has up to a 12 GB write-cache via compression. The adapter is a 64 bit, 3.3 V, bootable SAS adapter that supports RAID levels 0, 5, 6, and 10 as well as system level mirroring via the operating system. The adapter must be installed in pairs and must be used in a high availability, multi-initiator RAID configuration with two adapters in dual-controller mode (dual storage IOA configuration). Two FC EJ0L adapters provide additional performance and adapter redundancy with mirrored write-cache data and mirrored RAID parity footprints between the adapters. If the FC EJ0L pairing is broken, then the write cache is disabled. Integrated flash memory with capacitors provides protection of the write cache in case of power failure, without the need for batteries as were used with some previous large cache adapters. Part Number: EJ0L-91XX \n"

The minimum software release versions for these new MPAs are shown in Table 5 and Table 6. Supported pluggable interfaces are shown in Table 4.\nUsing modular line cards along with port adapters, the ASR 9000 Series can support a wide range of customer applications, including video on demand, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), point-to-point video, Internet video, and cloud-based computing. The line cards can also be used to deliver economical, scalable, highly available, line‑rate Ethernet, and IP/Multiprotocol Label Switching (IP/MPLS) edge services. Cisco ASR 9000 Series line cards and routers are designed to provide the fundamental infrastructure for scalable Carrier Ethernet and IP/MPLS networks, supporting profitable business, residential, and mobile services.\nSR 9000 Series line cards are fully compatible with the Cisco ASR 9922 Router, ASR 9912 Router, ASR 9910 Router, ASR 9906, ASR 9904 Router, ASR 9010 Router, and ASR 9006 Router, as well as ASR 9000 Series Route Switch Processors (RSPs), route processors, and other Typhoon Network Processing Unit (NPU)-based line cards. Total bandwidth is dependent on the number and type of RSPs installed.\nThe new 400G and 200G modular line cards deliver the ability to mix and match modular port adapters so that customers can customize each slot in the ASR 9000 to their specific port demands. For example, in the case of the 400G modular line cards, a 20-port 10 Gigabit Ethernet modular port adapter can be matched with a 2-port 100 Gigabit Ethernet modular port adapter, all in a single slot, for a total bandwidth of 400 gigabits per slot. In the case of a 200G modular line card, two 1-port 100 or 200 Gigabit Ethernet modular port adapters can be used per slot for a total of 200 or 400 gigabits per slot, or a single 2-port 100 Gigabit Ethernet or a single 20-port 10 Gigabit Ethernet modular port adapter can be used to get 200 gigabits per slot. Both the 200G and 400G modular cards are compatible with all earlier generations of port adapters.

    "description": "\nCisco A9K-MOD200-TR ASR 9000 Mod200 Modular Line Card, Packet Transport Optimized Part Number: A9K-MOD200-TR The new Cisco® ASR 9000 Series  and 200G Modular Line Cards provide customers with a highly flexible solution. They support multiple combinations of Ethernet ports, all in a single slot of the Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers (ASR 9000 Series). These modular line cards have two open bays (bay 0 and bay 1) for plugging in ASR 9000 Series Modular Port Adapters (MPA), which gives network operators the flexibility to choose the ideal port density, speed, and optic based on their network requirements. With ASR 9000 Series modular line cards and the MPA portfolio, Cisco continues to focus on investment protection, along with consistent feature support, broad interface availability, and the latest technology. The latest additions to the MPA portfolio include the Cisco ASR 9000 Series 20-Port 10GE Modular Port Adapter, the 2-Port 100GE Modular Port Adapter, the 1-port 100G Modular Port Adapter and the MACSec enabled 32 port 1GE Modular Port Adapter.  Using modular line cards along with port adapters, the ASR 9000 Series can support a wide range of customer applications, including video on demand, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), point-to-point video, Internet video, and cloud-based computing. The line cards can also be used to deliver economical, scalable, highly available, line‑rate Ethernet, and IP/Multiprotocol Label Switching (IP/MPLS) edge services. Cisco ASR 9000 Series line cards and routers are designed to provide the fundamental infrastructure for scalable Carrier Ethernet and IP/MPLS networks, supporting profitable business, residential, and mobile services. ASR 9000 Series line cards are fully compatible with the Cisco ASR 9922 Router, ASR 9912 Router, ASR 9910 Router, ASR 9906, ASR 9904 Router, ASR 9010 Router, and ASR 9006 Router, as well as ASR 9000 Series Route Switch Processors (RSPs), route processors, and other Typhoon Network Processing Unit (NPU)-based line cards. Total bandwidth is dependent on the number and type of RSPs installed. The new 200G modular line cards deliver the ability to mix and match modular port adapters so that customers can customize each slot in the ASR 9000 to their specific port demands. For example, in the case of a 200G modular line card, two 1-port 100 Gigabit Ethernet modular port adapters can be used per slot for a total of 200 gigabits per slot, or a single 2-port 100 Gigabit Ethernet or a single 20-port 10 Gigabit Ethernet modular port adapter can be used to get 200 gigabits per slot. The 200G modular cards are compatible with all earlier generations of port adapters. The new 32 port 1 Gigabit Ethernet modular port adapter in additional to all features, supports the hop by hop as well as WAN MACSec encryption. MACSec is the next-generation encryption technology in federal, enterprise, cloud and service provider transport networks. WAN MACSec provides capability to deploy seamlessly over any public carrier Ethernet, optical, DWDM/OTN transport network. The Cisco ASR 9000 Series 200G Modular Line Cards provide simultaneous support for both Layer 2 and Layer 3 services and features. This capability helps operators qualify and stock a single line card that can be deployed in any combination of Layer 2 and Layer 3 applications. It also helps reduce Capital Expenditures (CapEx) and Operating Expenses (OpEx), as well as reduce the time required to develop and deploy new services. Cisco modular line cards set exceptional standards for service density, allowing operators to offer predictable, managed transport services while optimizing the use of network assets. In the 200G modular line card, two modular port adapters are supported per line card, except for the 2-port 100 Gigabit modular port adapter and the 20-port 10 Gigabit modular port adapter. The 2-port 100 Gigabit and 20-port 10 Gigabit modular adapters are supported only in bay 0 of the 200G modular line card. The achievable port density on this line card is as follows: ● 20-port 10G or 64-port 1G interfaces● 4-port 40G interfaces● 2-port 100G interfaces The Cisco ASR 9000 Series modular line cards are available in Service Edge Optimized and Packet Transport Optimized variants.● Service Edge Optimized line cards are designed for customer deployments requiring enhanced quality of service (QoS).● Packet Transport Optimized line cards are designed for network deployments where basic QoS is required.Different line card types may be mixed within the same system. \n"

The enhanced performance of Gigabit Ethernet in Cisco ISR G2 routers enables new applications and services and provides greater capacity for existing IVR and bridging capabilities. Branch offices can now connect to Ethernet WAN (EWAN) Layer 2 and 3 services.\nNote: The EHWIC provides Gigabit Ethernet connectivity but will not support line rate since throughput is limited by the platforms. The maximum throughput cannot exceed 800 Mbps bidirectionally.\nFor flexibility, the EHWIC includes one SFP slot, which supports a Cisco SFP and a copper RJ-45 port, where either the SFP port (operating at 100/1000 Mbps) or the RJ-45 (operating at 10/100/1000 Mbps) port can be active at one time. The SFP port supports digital optical monitoring (DOM) as specified by the industry-standard SFF-8472 multisource agreement (MSA). This feature enables the end user to monitor real-time parameters of the SFP, such as optical output power, optical input power, temperature, laser bias current, and transceiver supply voltage.\n\n"

These high-capacity line cards are designed to remove bandwidth bottlenecks in the network that are caused by a large increase in video-on-demand (VoD), IPTV, point-to-point video, Internet video, and cloud services traffic. A single 100 Gigabit Ethernet port can now replace large 10 Gigabit Ethernet link aggregation bundles to simplify network operations. Based on Cisco CPAK technology, this line card has flexible interfaces that support 100 Gigabit Ethernet, 40 Gigabit Ethernet and 10 Gigabit Ethernet modes, so it gives customers the flexibility to mix and match interface types on the same line card.\nFor example, with the help of Cisco CPAK 10x10G-LR optics, a single 100 Gigabit Ethernet port can be divided into 10x10 Gigabit Ethernet ports using breakout cables or patch panels for unprecedented density and scale. These different interface modes can be configured easily through the command line interface (CLI) without resetting or restarting the line card. Using a “green design,” these line cards also let customers put an unused slice in power-saving mode to reduce power consumption. With these capabilities, the ASR 9000 Series line cards and routers provide the fundamental infrastructure for scalable Carrier Ethernet and IP/Multiprotocol Label Switching (IP/MPLS) networks, promoting profitable business, residential, and mobile services.\n"

    "description": "\nCisco 2 port Multi-flex Trunk Voice/Clear-channel Data T1/E1 Module for ISR4000-series Routers\nThe Cisco® Fourth-Generation 1-, 2-, 4-, and 8-Port T1/E1 Multiflex Trunk Voice and WAN Network Interface Modules (NIMs) support data and voice applications on the Cisco 4000 Integrated Services Routers (Figure 1). These cards combine WAN-interface-card (WIC), voice-interface-card (VIC), ISDN Primary Rate Interface (PRI), dial-access integration, and channelized-data (CE1T1) functions to provide superior flexibility, versatility, and investment protection through their many uses. Customers who choose to integrate data and voice in multiple steps preserve their investment in a T1/E1 WAN interface.\nYou can insert the Cisco T1/E1 NIMs into the NIM slot on the supported Cisco 4000 Integrated Services Routers (ISRs). In addition to the features listed in Table 1, these modules support both T1 and E1, providing additional flexibility for supporting T1, fractional T1, E1, and fractional E1 for both voice and WAN applications simultaneously. All modules include the drop-and-insert multiplexing capability, which eliminates costly external third-party channel service units/data service units (CSUs/DSUs) and drop-and-insert multiplexers.\nThe fourth-generation Cisco T1/E1 NIMs add improvements over the Cisco Second- and Third-Generation T1/E1 Multiflex Trunk Voice and WAN Interface Cards (MFT VWIC2s and VWIC3s, respectively). The fourth-generation T1/E1 modules enable each port to be clocked from an independent clock source for data applications. Voice applications can now be clocked independently from data applications, with all ports for voice applications clocked from a single source.\nThe T1/E1 modules contain an onboard Cisco Packet Voice Digital Signal Processor Module 4 (PVDM4) slot, which requires a fourth-generation PVDM4 module. A PVDM4 on the T1/E1 module is necessary for the voice features. The PVDM4 also provides for echo cancellation of up to 128-ms echo-tail length for demanding network conditions. Refer to Table 2 for all configuration options offered with the modules.\nThese fourth-generation modules also provide increased port density per chassis compared to the Cisco Integrated Services Routers Generation 2 (ISR G2) platform.\nKey Features● Basic T1/E1 data: The MFT versions act as WICs, supporting T1, fractional T1, E1, and fractional E1. To simplify remote management, these modules integrate a fully managed DSU/CSU for T1 deployments and a fully managed DSU for E1 deployments.● E1/G.703 data: In addition to the basic T1/E1 data support, the CE1T1 versions also support structured G.703 with G.704 framing and unstructured E1 (G.703) applications.● T1/E1 packet voice: All the modules support packet voice applications by providing T1, fractional T1, E1, and fractional E1 connections to private branch exchanges (PBXs) and central offices, thereby enabling new services and reducing voice and fax toll charges. An additional onboard PVDM4 is required. Also, each NIM has its own PVDM4, so each module can be connected to a different service provider with no single clock domain restriction.● Mixed data and packet voice: All the modules can simultaneously support both data and voice, reducing the complexity and number of network components and facilitating a graceful migration to bandwidth-efficient packet voice.● Mixed data and packet voice with drop and insert: You can deploy all the modules as T1/E1 drop-and-insert multiplexers with integrated DSUs/CSUs, reducing the complexity of the network and the cost of the central-office ports by efficiently combining time-division multiplexing (TDM) voice (PBX), IP voice, and data on the same trunks.\n"

Modular line cards support a wide range of interfaces and densities offering the benefits of network scalability with lower initial costs and ease of upgrades. The Cisco ASR 9000 modular line cards and modular port adapter portfolio continues the Cisco focus on investment protection along with consistent feature support, broad interface availability, and the latest technology.Using the modular line cards, the Cisco ASR 9000 Series can support customer applications including video-on-demand, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), point-to-point video, Internet video, and cloud-based computing. These line cards can also be used to deliver economical, scalable, highly available, line-rate Ethernet and IP/Multiprotocol Label Switching (IP/MPLS) edge services. The Cisco ASR 9000 Series line cards and routers are designed to provide the fundamental infrastructure for scalable Carrier Ethernet and IP/MPLS networks, supporting profitable business, residential, and mobile services\nThe Cisco ASR 9000 Series modular line cards are fully compatible with the Cisco ASR 9922, 9010, and 9006 systems, route switch processors (RSPs), and line cards. No hardware upgrade to the chassis or cooling system is required. Total bandwidth is dependent on the number and type of RSPs installed.The new line cards deliver the ability to mix and match modular port adapters so that customers can customize each slot in the Cisco ASR 9000 to their specific port demands. As an example, a 4-port 10-Gigabit Ethernet modular port adapter can be matched with a 20-port 1-Gigabit Ethernet modular port adapter, all in a single slot.Each Cisco ASR 9000 Series modular line card provides simultaneous support for both Layer 2 and Layer 3 services and features, helping operators to qualify and stock a single line card that can be deployed in any combination of Layer 2 and Layer 3 applications. These capabilities help to reduce capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx), as well as reduce the time required to develop and deploy new services. The Cisco modular line cards set a new standard for service density, allowing operators to offer predictable, managed transport services while optimizing the use of network assets.The line cards, with their synchronization circuitry and dedicated backplane timing traces for accessing the RSP’s Stratum-3 subsystem, provide standards-based line-interface functions for delivering and deriving transport-class network timing, allowing support of network-synchronized services and applications such as mobile backhaul and time-division multiplexing (TDM) migration. Coupled with the Cisco RSP-440 route switch processor, the line cards can also be used for applications requiring IEEE 1588v2 synchronization services. Recognizing that real-time media dominate next-generation services, Cisco has integrated media-monitoring technology into the Cisco Modular line cards. This multimedia technology allows real-time monitoring and statistics collection of real-time video and voice flows, facilitating proactive maintenance and management of today’s interactive services.Addressing the advantages of consolidating IP and dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) networking, G.709 with Advanced Forward Error Correction (FEC) is provided. G.709 provides visibility into the DWDM transmission system to permit rapid detection and recovery from transmission-layer and DWDM impairments. G.709 can also be configured for proactive protection if signal degradation is detected; it prevents traffic loss and link outage. Advanced FEC extends transmission-layer performance, delivering extended performance over an amplified system without the cost of regeneration or transponders.\nLine Card TypesThe Cisco ASR 9000 Series modular line cards are available in Service Edge Optimized and Packet Transport Optimized variants.● Service Edge Optimized line cards are designed for customer deployments requiring enhanced quality of service (QoS).● Packet Transport Optimized line cards are designed for network deployments where basic QoS is required.Different line card types may be mixed within the same system.\n\n"

The line cards are capable of 40-Gbps full-duplex traffic forwarding using a fixed-port interface design. The ASR1000-6TGE has six 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports (Figure 2).The Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP) and 10-Gbps SFP (XFP) modules allow you to configure the line card for different media types (copper or fiber) and different optical requirements (single- or multimode fiber), as available. The line cards have one power LED, one line-card status LED, and 22 port or link-status LEDs.\nWith these line cards, the ASR 1000 Series routers can achieve greater Ethernet density and a lower price per port. However, this fixed configuration means that the Ethernet line cards are not compatible with the Shared Port Adapters (SPAs) that are currently used with the SPA interface processors. Instead, the Ethernet line cards take the slot of the SPA interface processor. \nther aspects of the fixed Ethernet line cards and the modular interface processor include:\n●   Rich Ethernet Layer 2, Layer 3, IP, IPv6, and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) packet-processing capabilities, as previously provided on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series platforms\n●   Rich Quality-of-Service (QoS) functions:\n◦     Ingress and egress QoS, as previously provided on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series platforms\n◦     Egress queuing capability, as previously provided on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series platforms\n◦     High- and low-priority lanes to Cisco ASR 1000 Series Embedded Services Processors for high priority, low-latency forwarding\n \n\n"

Recognizing that real-time media dominate next-generation services, Cisco has integrated media-monitoring technology into the Cisco Modular line cards. This multimedia technology allows real-time monitoring and statistics collection of real-time video and voice flows, facilitating proactive maintenance and management of today’s interactive services. Addressing the advantages of consolidating IP and dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) networking, G.709 with Advanced Forward Error Correction (FEC) is provided. G.709 provides visibility into the DWDM transmission system to permit rapid detection and recovery from transmission-layer and DWDM impairments. G.709 can also be configured for proactive protection if signal degradation is detected; it prevents traffic loss and link outage. Advanced FEC extends transmission-layer performance, delivering extended performance over an amplified system without the cost of regeneration or transponders. The Cisco ASR 9000 Series modular line cards are available in Service Edge Optimized and Packet Transport Optimized variants.● Service Edge Optimized line cards are designed for customer deployments requiring enhanced quality of service (QoS).● Packet Transport Optimized line cards are designed for network deployments where basic QoS is required.Different line card types may be mixed within the same system. \n"

    "description": "\nCisco A9K-MOD200-TR ASR 9000 Mod200 Modular Line Card, Packet Transport Optimized Part Number: A9K-MOD200-TR The new Cisco® ASR 9000 Series  and 200G Modular Line Cards provide customers with a highly flexible solution. They support multiple combinations of Ethernet ports, all in a single slot of the Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers (ASR 9000 Series). These modular line cards have two open bays (bay 0 and bay 1) for plugging in ASR 9000 Series Modular Port Adapters (MPA), which gives network operators the flexibility to choose the ideal port density, speed, and optic based on their network requirements. With ASR 9000 Series modular line cards and the MPA portfolio, Cisco continues to focus on investment protection, along with consistent feature support, broad interface availability, and the latest technology. The latest additions to the MPA portfolio include the Cisco ASR 9000 Series 20-Port 10GE Modular Port Adapter, the 2-Port 100GE Modular Port Adapter, the 1-port 100G Modular Port Adapter and the MACSec enabled 32 port 1GE Modular Port Adapter.  Using modular line cards along with port adapters, the ASR 9000 Series can support a wide range of customer applications, including video on demand, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), point-to-point video, Internet video, and cloud-based computing. The line cards can also be used to deliver economical, scalable, highly available, line‑rate Ethernet, and IP/Multiprotocol Label Switching (IP/MPLS) edge services. Cisco ASR 9000 Series line cards and routers are designed to provide the fundamental infrastructure for scalable Carrier Ethernet and IP/MPLS networks, supporting profitable business, residential, and mobile services. ASR 9000 Series line cards are fully compatible with the Cisco ASR 9922 Router, ASR 9912 Router, ASR 9910 Router, ASR 9906, ASR 9904 Router, ASR 9010 Router, and ASR 9006 Router, as well as ASR 9000 Series Route Switch Processors (RSPs), route processors, and other Typhoon Network Processing Unit (NPU)-based line cards. Total bandwidth is dependent on the number and type of RSPs installed. The new 200G modular line cards deliver the ability to mix and match modular port adapters so that customers can customize each slot in the ASR 9000 to their specific port demands. For example, in the case of a 200G modular line card, two 1-port 100 Gigabit Ethernet modular port adapters can be used per slot for a total of 200 gigabits per slot, or a single 2-port 100 Gigabit Ethernet or a single 20-port 10 Gigabit Ethernet modular port adapter can be used to get 200 gigabits per slot. The 200G modular cards are compatible with all earlier generations of port adapters. The new 32 port 1 Gigabit Ethernet modular port adapter in additional to all features, supports the hop by hop as well as WAN MACSec encryption. MACSec is the next-generation encryption technology in federal, enterprise, cloud and service provider transport networks. WAN MACSec provides capability to deploy seamlessly over any public carrier Ethernet, optical, DWDM/OTN transport network. The Cisco ASR 9000 Series 200G Modular Line Cards provide simultaneous support for both Layer 2 and Layer 3 services and features. This capability helps operators qualify and stock a single line card that can be deployed in any combination of Layer 2 and Layer 3 applications. It also helps reduce Capital Expenditures (CapEx) and Operating Expenses (OpEx), as well as reduce the time required to develop and deploy new services. Cisco modular line cards set exceptional standards for service density, allowing operators to offer predictable, managed transport services while optimizing the use of network assets. In the 200G modular line card, two modular port adapters are supported per line card, except for the 2-port 100 Gigabit modular port adapter and the 20-port 10 Gigabit modular port adapter. The 2-port 100 Gigabit and 20-port 10 Gigabit modular adapters are supported only in bay 0 of the 200G modular line card. The achievable port density on this line card is as follows: ● 20-port 10G or 64-port 1G interfaces● 4-port 40G interfaces● 2-port 100G interfaces The Cisco ASR 9000 Series modular line cards are available in Service Edge Optimized and Packet Transport Optimized variants.● Service Edge Optimized line cards are designed for customer deployments requiring enhanced quality of service (QoS).● Packet Transport Optimized line cards are designed for network deployments where basic QoS is required.Different line card types may be mixed within the same system. \n"

The Cisco ASR 9000 Series line cards and routers are designed to provide the fundamental infrastructure for scalable Carrier Ethernet and IP/MPLS networks, allowing profitable business, residential, and mobile services The Cisco ASR 9000 Series 36-Port 10 Gigabit Ethernet Line Cards are fully compatible with all Cisco ASR 9000 Series chassis, route switch processors (RSPs), and line cards. No hardware upgrade to the chassis or cooling system is required. Total bandwidth is dependent on the number and type of RSPs installed. The Cisco ASR 9000 Series 36-Port 10 Gigabit Ethernet Line Cards are also fully compatible with the 22-slot Cisco ASR 9922 chassis. Each line card provides simultaneous support for both Layer 2 and Layer 3 services and features, helping operators qualify and stock a single line card that can be deployed in any combination of Layer 2 and Layer 3 applications, thereby reducing capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx), as well as reducing the time required to develop and deploy new services. The Cisco ASR 9000 Series Ethernet line cards set a new standard for Layer 2 and Layer 3 service density and scale, allowing operators to offer predictable, managed transport services while optimizing the use of network assets. The line cards, with their synchronization circuitry and dedicated backplane timing traces for accessing the RSP’s Stratum-3 subsystem, provide standards-based line-interface functions for delivering and deriving transport-class network timing, allowing support of network-synchronized services and applications such as mobile backhaul and time-division multiplexing (TDM) migration. Coupled with the proper RSP, the line cards can also be used for applications requiring IEEE 1588v2 synchronization services. Recognizing that real-time media dominate next-generation services, Cisco has integrated media-monitoring technology into the Cisco ASR 9000 Series Ethernet line cards. This multimedia technology allows real-time monitoring and statistics collection of real-time video and voice flows, facilitating proactive maintenance and management of today’s comprehensive media services. Addressing the advantages of consolidating IP with the transport network, G.709 with Advanced Forward Error Correction (FEC) is provided. G.709 provides visibility into the transmission system to permit rapid detection and recovery from transmission-layer impairments. G.709 can also be configured for proactive protection if signal degradation is detected; it prevents traffic loss and link outages. Advanced FEC extends transmission-layer performance, delivering extended performance over an amplified system without the cost of regeneration or transponders. Options: Each line card is available as either a Service Edge Optimized (enhanced QoS) or Packet Transport Optimized (basic QoS) line card \n"

As a result, the ESPs enable the ASR 1000s to support the following functions and features with high performance: ●   Forwarding, traffic management, and services ●   Large-scale parallel processing with centralized shared memory to achieve low-latency packet processing ●   High-performance deep-packet inspection (DPI) with full visibility into the entire Layer 2 frame, including payload ●   Rapid feature development with ANSI-C software development framework ●   Up to 200-Gbps system throughput and up to 130 millions of packets per second (mpps) to address WAN aggregation needs ●   Hardware-assisted cryptographic performance to yield up to 78 Gbps of throughput to enable secure WAN access and compliance ●   Line-speed zone-based firewall that provides up to 200 Gbps of throughput and 6-mpps firewall sessions ●   DPI, Cisco IOS® Software Zone-Based Firewall distributed denial of service (DDoS) detection and prevention, and control-plane protection   \n"

The platform is built on modern system-architecture designed to provide high performance and meet the evolving needs of highly scalable data centers and growing enterprises.\nThe product is designed to support innovative technologies such as Media Access Control Security (MACsec), Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN), tunnel endpoint VTEP-to¬-VTEP overlay encryption, CloudSec and Streaming Statistics Export (SSX). MACsec is a security technology that allows traffic encryption at the physical layer and provides secure server, border leaf, and leaf-to-spine connectivity. SSX is hardware-based, consisting of a module that reads statistics from the ASIC and sends them to a remote server for analysis. Through this application, users can better understand network performance without any impact on the switch control plane or CPU.\nCisco provides two modes of operation for Cisco Nexus® 9000 Series Switches. Organizations can use Cisco NX-OS Software to deploy the switches in standard Cisco Nexus switch environments (NX-OS mode).

These line cards are functionally transparent; all the packet processing, queuing, buffering, and QoS occur in the supervisor engine. To that end, both classic and E-Series line cards acquire the features and capabilities of the installed supervisor engine. For example, a classic line card previously deployed with a classic supervisor engine using four queues per port will automatically have capability for eight queues per port if redeployed with a Supervisor Engine 8-E/7-E/6-E. This architecture enables customers to easily upgrade all Ethernet line cards on their Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series systems to higher layer switching functions by adding a new supervisor engine. The simple design of the line cards results in a very high mean time between failures (MTBF), helping ensure high availability for a single connection to an end user.\n"

    "price": "$2,600.00",
    "description": "\nThe next-generation Cisco® MDS 9700 40-Gbps 24-Port Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) Module provides Cisco Unified Fabric connectivity to the SAN core. It empowers midsize and large enterprises that are rapidly deploying cloud-scale applications with Inter-Switch Link (ISL) consolidation by four to one over traditional 10Gbps FCoE and three to one over 16Gbps FC, and exceptional investment protection for their SANs. The data center fabric is already using 40-Gbps connectivity in the core for more efficient convergence, higher performance, and lower total cost of ownership (TCO). With the entire Cisco Nexus® Family supporting 40-Gbps FCoE, this capability can now be extended to the SAN core. You can extend the benefits of FCoE beyond the access layer to the data center core with a full line-rate FCoE module for the Cisco MDS 9700 Series Multilayer Directors.\nThe main features of the MDS 9700 40-Gbps 24-Port FCoE Module include:\n●   High performance: MDS 9700 Series architecture, based on central arbitration and crossbar fabric, provides 40-Gbps line-rate, non-blocking, predictable performance across all traffic conditions for every FCoE port in the chassis.\n●   CAPEX reduction: The 40Gbps FCoE capable ports support QSFP-40G-SR4-BD transceivers that allow users to deploy them on existing 10Gbps cable plants without having to rip and replace existing cabling in their data center thus greatly reducing capital expenditure.\n●   Higher Bandwidth: FCoE takes advantage of full bandwidth utilization on a 40-Gbps Ethernet link to provide 294 percent the bandwidth of 16-Gbps Fibre Channel (the actual throughput of 16-Gbps Fibre Channel is 13.6 Gbps). Therefore, you need fewer 40-Gbps links to achieve the same bandwidth as with multiple 16-Gbps links.\n●   High availability: MDS 9700 Series directors provide outstanding availability and reliability. These are the industry's first director-class switches that offer redundancy on all major components. They provide grid redundancy on the power supply and 1+1 redundant supervisors. Users can also can add fabric cards to enable N+1 fabric redundancy.\n●   Scalability: The MDS 9700 FCoE module provides up to 384 40-Gbps, full line-rate, ports in a single Cisco MDS 9718 Multilayer Director chassis or 192 40-Gbps, full line-rate, autosensing ports in a single Cisco MDS 9710 Multilayer Director chassis or up to 96 40-Gbps full line-rate ports in a single Cisco MDS 9706 Multilayer Director chassis.\n●   Resilient high-performance ISLs: FCoE ISLs can be grouped into port channels with up to 16 physical links, creating massive 640-Gbps logical links. When you connect to Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches populated with Cisco Nexus 7000 Series 40 Gigabit Ethernet modules, you can easily scale the number of director-class FCoE ports to meet the needs of the most demanding data center environments.\n●   Intelligent network services: VSAN technology, access control lists (ACLs) for hardware-based intelligent frame processing, and fabricwide quality of service (QoS) enable migration from SAN islands to enterprisewide storage networks.\n●   Sophisticated diagnostics: The MDS 9700 FCoE module provides intelligent diagnostics, protocol decoding, network analysis tools, and integrated Cisco Call Home capability for greater reliability, faster problem resolution, and reduced service costs.\n●   Programmable fabric: The MDS 9700 Series provides powerful representational state transfer (REST) and Cisco NX-API capabilities to enable flexible and rapid programming of utilities for the SAN.\n\n"

This switch is well suited for customers who want to reuse existing copper cabling while migrating from 1-Gbps to 10-Gbps servers. The Cisco Nexus 3064 switches provide the following main benefits:   Wire-rate Layer 2 and 3 switching on all ports  The Cisco Nexus 3064 switches provide Layer 2 and 3 switching of up to 1.2 terabits per second (Tbps) and more than 950 million packets per second (mpps) in a compact 1RU form factor.   Ultra-low latency  The Cisco Nexus 3064 switches deliver ultra-low nominal latency that allows customers to implement high‑performance infrastructure for high-frequency trading (HFT) workloads.   Purpose-built on Cisco NX-OS operating system with comprehensive, proven innovations  Virtual PortChannel (vPC) provides Layer 2 multipathing through the elimination of Spanning Tree Protocol and enables fully utilized bisectional bandwidth and simplified Layer 2 logical topologies without the need to change the existing management and deployment models. PowerOn Auto Provisioning (POAP) enables touchless bootup and configuration of the switch, drastically reducing provisioning time. Cisco Embedded Event Manager (EEM) and Python scripting enable automation and remote operations in the data center. Advanced buffer monitoring reports real-time buffer use per port and per queue, which allows organizations to monitor traffic bursts and application traffic patterns. The 64-way equal-cost multipath (ECMP) routing enables Layer 3 fat tree designs and allows organizations to prevent network bottlenecks, increase resiliency, and add capacity with little network disruption. EtherAnalyzer is a built-in packet analyzer for monitoring and troubleshooting control-plane traffic and is based on the popular Wireshark open source network protocol analyzer. Precision Time Protocol (PTP; IEEE 1588) provides accurate clock synchronization and improved data correlation with network captures and system events. Full Layer 3 unicast and multicast routing protocol suites are supported, including Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), Routing Information Protocol Version 2 (RIPv2), Protocol Independent Multicast sparse mode (PIM-SM), Source-Specific Multicast (SSM), and Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP).   Network traffic monitoring with Cisco Nexus Data Broker  Build simple, scalable and cost-effective network tap or Cisco Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) aggregation for network traffic monitoring and analysis.   ● Cisco Nexus 3064-T  48 fixed 10GBASE-T ports (can operate at 100-Mbps, 1-Gbps, and 10-Gbps speeds) Four fixed QSFP+ ports (each QSFP+ port can support 4 x 10 Gigabit Ethernet or 40 Gigabit Ethernet)  \n"

    "description": "\nThe Cisco Catalyst 6509-E Fan Tray is pertinent in getting the Cisco Catalyst chassis to run correctly, as most of them do not come with fan trays. When a nine-bay E-series chassis is weighted with a full complement of network modules, this fan tray is the only approved device designed to handle the heat generated. If something goes wrong the fan failure LED will come on. It can easily be replaced by undoing the two captive installation screws and pulling the unit out of the chassis using the tough handle on its face.  The fan pulls air all the way through and out the side of the cabinet which prevents things from getting too hot inside and eliminates the uneven temperature gradients common to most wiring cabinets and switch chassis.

Working in conjunction with the Catalyst® 6500-E/6807-XL Supervisor Engine 2T/2TXL (VS-S2T-10G & VS-S2T-10GXL), they can serve different needs on campus deployments. The family includes three modules: the Catalyst 6800 32-port, 16-port, and 8-port 10-Gigabit Ethernet Fiber Modules. The modules support hardware-based multicast replication, Quality of Service (QoS), Access Control Lists (ACLs), jumbo frames, and low latency to enable secure and predictable performance for bandwidth-intensive applications. All three share a common ASIC architecture and support the same set of features in hardware. They support Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP/SFP+), 10/100/1000M GLC-T (1G copper SFP) transceivers, and 100M FX. The modules are designed to meet the increasing demand for aggregation of 10-Gigabit Ethernet streams in campus deployments, as well as for high-density 10-Gigabit Ethernet transport in the core. The modules consist of port groups of eight ports each. The 32-port and 16-port modules can operate in either of two modes: 1) oversubscribed mode (default), which provides for maximum port density, using all of the ports with 2:1 oversubscription; and 2) performance mode, which uses half of the ports, enabling line rates and double the port buffer size. The mode of operation can be changed for each eight-port port-group (mixed mode), and is described in more detail in the following sections. The eight-port 10-Gigabit Ethernet Module always operates in performance mode. The modules are based on the WS-X6904-40G module and provide the same level of advanced enterprise features and large table sizes that have proven essential to successful operation as a campus aggregation or core switch. They include hardware features such as Virtual Switching System (VSS), Instant Access (IA), Location ID Separation Protocol (LISP), Security Group Tagging (SGT) and Access Control (SGACL), MACsec (802.1ae), traffic shaping, and Hierarchical Quality of Service (HQoS), among others. The line cards are also the first to launch with front-facing passive UHF RFID technology, providing the latest Auto-ID capabilities for asset management.

Also, the wired plus wireless features are bundled into a single Cisco IOS Software image, which reduces the number of software images that users have to qualify/certify before enabling them in their network. The single console port for Command-Line Interface (CLI) management reduces the number of touch points to manage for wired plus wireless services, thereby reducing network complexity, simplifying network operations, and lowering the TCO to manage the infrastructure. Converged wired plus wireless not only improves wireless bandwidth across the network but also the scale of wireless deployment. Each 48-port Cisco Catalyst 3850 provides 40 Gbps of wireless throughput (20 Gbps on the 24-port/12-port models). This wireless capacity increases with the number of members in the stack. This makes sure that the network can scale with current wireless bandwidth requirements, as dictated by IEEE 802.11n-based access points and with future wireless standards such as IEEE 802.11ac.
